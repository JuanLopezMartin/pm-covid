12,No NIH Category available.,"Project SummaryThe NIAID national protocol intends to enroll at least 1000 COVID19 patients in a study designed to track infectedpatients through tracking, over time, their immune responses, viral load, and a variety of multi-omic analytes thatcan provide deep insights into how infection by SARS-CoV-2 is revealed in host defense responses and disease-perturbed networks. At the heart of this study is the establishment of high quality biorepositories that can beused to quantitatively assess viral load, quantitatively interrogate viable PBMCs, and permit direct comparisonsbetween different patients and different time points of disease progression. The nature of the infection, withhighly differential patient outcomes, will eventually require significant computational efforts that can account forconfounding factors such as co-morbidities, the influence of various therapies that are being broadly tested inthese patients, etc. It will also certainly require both broadly available immune characterization tools that can beapplied on all patient samples, but also specialized tools that can be used to inform the interpretation of thegeneral analytics. In this project, we propose to integrate two sets of immune cell characterizations into thenational NIAID effort. Those characterizations include single cell, functional phenotyping of select immune cellclasses via an analysis designed to quantitate the levels of 35 secreted proteins from up to 2000 single cells ofa given immune cell type. The second characterization is based upon reducing proteins from the SARS-CoV-2into peptide antigen-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) libraries that can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations from isolated, viable PBMCs.

14,No NIH Category available.,"PROJECT SUMMARYVaccination is the most effective method for preventing infectious diseases. Many current vaccines are?inactivated? or ?subunit? vaccines composed of purified or recombinant pathogen components to which anadjuvant is often added to increase the magnitude of antibody responses. However, subunit vaccines formulatedwith current FDA-approved adjuvants do not sufficiently boost immunity in some populations, particularlyimmunocompromised and elderly subjects. Numerous adjuvants have been discovered in recent years and showenhanced immunogenicity as single agents; however, little is known about the activity of their combination, theirsafety, their efficacy and their mechanisms of action. Responses to vaccination and adjuvants involve dendriticcells (DCs), which capture and present vaccine antigens thereby facilitating the differentiation of follicular helperT cells (Tfh) and B cells and subsequent humoral immunity. Therefore, we propose to examine the molecularmechanisms and functional outputs of human DC subsets exposed to combination adjuvants ex vivo and in vivo.The focus on human DCs is essential given the substantial differences in innate immune receptor distributionand function between the mouse and the human. Our goal is to select a combination adjuvant using functionalassays, followed by in-depth investigation of molecular pathways accounting for enhanced immunogenicity. Ourcollaboration with industry will enable the transition of the selected combination adjuvant to further studies ofhuman vaccination. Our Specific Aims are built towards this goal. Thus, first we will screen adjuvant combinationsby assessing the capacity of adjuvant-activated human DC subsets to skew the differentiation of naïve CD4+Tcells into Tfh cells that secrete IL-21 and induce B cells to produce IgG and IgA antibodies (Aim 1). Promisingcombinations will be further studied in DCs using validated, sensitive and high-throughput transcriptomicepigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic methods, and by functional knockdown in vitro, to determine theunderlying molecular pathways of adjuvant efficacy (Aim 2). We will then validate the identified molecularpathways through functional knockdown studies in vivo using humanized mice carrying a functionallyreconstituted human immune system, which will also enable the examination of possible side effects (Aim 3).The proposed research program will leverage cutting-edge epigenetic (ATAC-seq), transcriptional, gene editing(CRISPR/Cas9) and metabolomic technologies; innovative humanized mouse models; a powerful computationaland bioinformatics infrastructure at The Jackson Laboratory; and the complementary expertise of a dynamicteam of investigators.

16,No NIH Category available.,"Abstract:SARS-CoV2 is causing an unprecedented pandemic that is likely to result in millions of deaths, with devastatingeconomic and public health consequences. Approximately 10% of SARS-CoV2 infections result in COVID-19pneumonia that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A growing body of evidencesuggests that the host inflammatory response plays a major role in driving severe disease outcomes. Therefore,it is essential to understand how SARS-CoV2 interacts with the host inflammatory response to drive COVID-19pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that bats, which are the natural reservoir of group 2b coronaviruses likeSARS-CoV2, have dampened NLRP3 function, which may allow these viruses to infect bats without causingserious disease. This indicates that NLRP3 or other NLR inflammasomes, may play an important role in SARS-CoV2-induced inflammation and thereby drive virus-induced respiratory pathology. Given that these genes andpathways are also polymorphic in humans, this raises the possibility that genetic variation in NLR gene networksmay contribute to variation in SARS-CoV2 susceptibility. Therefore, we propose to take advantage of ourresearch team?s unique capabilities in SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis and mouse genetics to directly test whetherNLRP3 or other NLR inflammasome pathways contribute to SARS-CoV2-induced disease. We will also testwhether genetic variation in these pathways affects disease outcome or virus-induced immunity. This effort willbe further enhanced by a collaboration with Drs. Gary Nolan and Richard Ulevitch (U19AI100627), which willallow us to test whether these genes/pathways are activated during SARS-CoV2 infection in humans. Therefore,the proposed studies, which fall within the scope or the parent grant U19AI100625, achieve three critical researchgoals by: 1) testing the role of NLRP3 and related pathways in driving SARS-CoV2 disease pathogenesis, 2)testing whether genetic variation in these pathways affects SARS-CoV2-induced inflammatory responses oradaptive immunity, and 3) developing novel mouse models that reproduce key features of COVID-19 diseasepathogenesis and inflammation.",2019-nCoV;adaptive immunity;Address;Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Affect;Animals;Automobile Driving;Biological Models;Biology;Cells;Cessation of life;Chiroptera;Collaborations;Coronavirus;coronavirus disease;COVID-19;Disease;Disease Outcome;Economics;falls;Family member;Genes;Genetic Variation;Goals;Health system;Human;Immunity;Immunocompetent;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Infection;Inflammasome;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;Laboratories;Lung;Methodology;Modeling;mouse genetics;mouse model;Mouse Strains;Mus;novel;novel marker;pandemic disease;parent grant;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Play;Pneumonia;Predisposition;programs;Public Health;quantitative imaging;Research;respiratory;response;Role;Severity of illness;Shapes;Site;targeted treatment;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;tool;Variant;Virus;Virus Replication;,Testing the role of NLRP3 and other NLR Family Members in COVID19 pathogenesis,Project NarrativeA growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant host inflammatory responses contribute to severe COVID-19 disease outcomes.

17,No NIH Category available.,"Abstract: Emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV, influenza A virus (IAV), and West Nile virus (WNV) causehigh levels of morbidity and mortality in human populations. Host immune responses can play either protectiveor a pathologic role during viral infections. Therefore, understanding of the regulatory networks and signalingpathways that determine the magnitude and quality of an individual's antiviral immune response has importantimplications for human health, since these genes/pathways could be therapeutically targeted to treat virus-induced disease, or may represent targets for enhancing the safety and efficacy of vaccines against a widerange of viral pathogens.Polymorphic host genes and regulatory networks have a major impact on immune response variation in humanpopulations. However, confounding environmental factors and/or ethical concerns limit the types of studiesthat can be conducted in humans. Therefore, genetically tractable model systems that capture the range ofgenetic and phenotypic diversity seen in humans, such as the Collaborative Cross (CC) are needed tomechanistically dissect the genetics of immune variation. Our research team has quantified variation inbaseline, as well as SARS-CoV, IAV, and WNV-induced immune responses in a panel of 110 CC RIX lines(reproducible F1 crosses between CC recombinant inbred (RI) lines that model heterozygous humanpopulations). To our knowledge, this represents to most comprehensive analysis of immune response variationever conducted in a genetic reference population, and in ongoing QTL mapping studies, we have identified100+ quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in virus-induced innate and adaptive immunity,inflammation and disease. Our program, which includes expertise in viral pathogenesis, innate and adaptiveimmunity, and quantitative genetics will use this unprecedented data base to: 1) identify and characterizepolymorphic host genes that drive variation in virus-induced disease, 2) test how interactions between differentpolymorphic genes/loci shape the host immune response, 3) test how these genes impact responses to otherviral pathogens, or function during allergy/auto-immunity, and 4) test the impact of these genes in the contextof human infections to identify targets for diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic interventions in humans.These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of how host genetic variation shapes virus-inducedimmunity and/or disease.",adaptive immunity;Affect;Antiviral Agents;Autoimmunity;Automobile Driving;biodefense;Biological Models;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;cohort;Data Set;Databases;Diagnosis;Disease;Environmental Risk Factor;Ethics;Gene Combinations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Variation;genome editing;genomic locus;Health;Human;Hypersensitivity;Immune;Immune response;Immune System Diseases;Immunity;Immunogenetics;Inbreeding;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Influenza A virus;Maps;Mediating;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse genetics;Mus;Natural Immunity;pathogen;Pathogenesis;pathogenic virus;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Play;Population;Preventive Intervention;programs;Quantitative Genetics;Quantitative Trait Loci;Recombinants;Reproducibility;Research;Research Design;respiratory virus;response;Role;Sampling;SARS coronavirus;Shapes;Signal Pathway;System;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;therapeutic target;Time;tool;vaccine efficacy;vaccine safety;Variant;Viral Pathogenesis;Virus;Virus Diseases;West Nile virus;,Systems Immunogenetics of Biodefense and Emerging Pathogens in the Collaborative Cross,Narrative: Host genetic variation has a major impact on virus-induced immunity; and the proposed studies will utilizethe Collaborative Cross and Human cohorts to understand how host genetic variation impacts virus-induced immunityand disease.,NIAID,10134680,16-Apr-20,RFA-AI-16-050,3U19AI100625-08S1,3,U19,AI,100625,8,S1,"LIU, QIAN",16-Apr-20,31-Aug-21,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAI1-PA-I (M3)),,1885536,"BARIC, RALPH S ","HEISE, MARK T",4.0,PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE,608195277,US,35.926939000000004,-79.038605,578206,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,27599-0001,UNITED STATES, ,16-Apr-20,31-Aug-20,855,Research Projects,2020,NIAID,364784.0,198723.0,563507,,"['baric, ralph s', 'heise, mark t']","['baric, ralph s', '']"
18,No NIH Category available.,"Project SummaryZoonotic viruses, like filoviruses and coronaviruses (CoV), represent a continuous and growing threat to globalpublic health because they unpredictably emerge causing devastating outbreaks of pandemic disease. In the21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools of viruses, causing severe disease inhumans. MERS-CoV is endemic in camels in the Middle East with continuous new infections in humans.Although SARS-CoV is not currently a threat, several ?prepandemic? SARS-like CoVs have been isolated frombats that replicate efficiently in human cells and are resistant to existing therapies. With the unpredictableoverlap of human and wild animal ecologies, the potential for novel CoV emergence into humans is highlyprobable. Currently, there are no approved antiviral therapies for any human CoV infection. Broad-spectrumCoV therapies that control known human and zoonotic CoV infections would address an immediate unmetmedical need and could counter future pandemic episodes. In partnership with Gilead Sciences, we havedemonstrated that the nucleoside prodrug, GS-5734, is highly efficacious in inhibiting multiple human andzoonotic CoV in vitro and SARS-CoV in vivo. The primary goal of our program is to accelerate the preclinicaldevelopment of GS-5734 and promote IND licensure for the MERS-CoV indication. To thoroughly evaluate thebreadth of antiviral activity and predict efficacy against future emerging CoV, we will also assess efficacyagainst a panel of CoV representative of family-wide genetic diversity, including prepandemic zoonotic strainspoised for emergence. Focusing on the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, our unique partnership integrates: i)metagenomics and recombinant virus synthetic genome recovery, ii) primary human lung cell models, iii)cutting edge virology and biochemistry, iv) robust murine and primate models of human disease and v) state ofthe art metabolic and pharmacokinetic analysis. In Aim 1, we refine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamicsand breadth of GS-5734 through efficacy and metabolism studies in various primary human cells with a diversearray of human and zoonotic CoV and through the evaluation of in vivo efficacy in murine and non-humanprimate models of MERS- and SARS-CoV. In Aim 2, we select for resistance against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and determine the effect of resistance on virus replication, fitness and susceptibility to treatment. In Aim3, we determine if the mechanism of action of GS-5734 is a result of direct effects on viral RNA replicationand/or alteration of antiviral immunity via deep sequencing and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situhybridization of vehicle or drug treated infected cells and mice. We articulate a development strategy for broad-spectrum therapeutics that could be extended to a multitude of emerging viral pathogens threatening globalpublic health.",Address;aged;airway epithelium;alveolar type II cell;animal ecology;Animal Model;Animals;anti-viral efficacy;Antiviral Agents;antiviral immunity;Antiviral Therapy;Attenuated;Biochemistry;biological systems;Birds;Camels;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell model;Cells;Chiroptera;clinical application;Clinical Trials;Coronavirus;coronavirus disease;Coronavirus Infections;coronavirus receptor;cross-species transmission;Data;deep sequencing;design;Development;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Drug Kinetics;drug metabolism;efficacy study;Endothelium;Engineering;Epithelial Cells;esterase;Exons;Family;Filovirus;fitness;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Fostering;Future;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Variation;Genome;Goals;Hepatitis;Human;human coronavirus;human disease;human model;Immune;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;in vivo imaging;Infection;Innate Immune Response;Licensure;Lung;Mammals;Measurement;Mediating;Medical;Metabolic;metabolic abnormality assessment;Metabolism;Metagenomics;Middle East;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;nonhuman primate;novel coronavirus;Nucleosides;pandemic disease;Parents;Pathogenesis;pathogenic virus;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics;Pharmacologic Substance;pre-clinical;preclinical development;Predisposition;Primates;Prodrugs;programs;Proteins;Public Health;recombinant virus;Recovery;remdesivir;replicase;Resistance;resistance mutation;Resistance profile;Resolution;RNA;RNA chemical synthesis;RNA replication;RNA Viruses;RNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;SARS coronavirus;Science;Serum;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome;single molecule;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Toxic effect;transcriptome sequencing;Transgenic Mice;Treatment Efficacy;tripolyphosphate;uptake;viral fitness;Viral Genome;Viral Pathogenesis;viral RNA;virology;Virus;Virus Replication;Wild Animals;Zoonoses;,Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 to treat MERS-CoV and related emerging CoV,Project NarrativeIn partnership with Gilead Sciences; we aim to accelerate the preclinical development of GS-5734 and promoteIND licensure.

The central hypothesis for the proposed studies is that elevated mbIL-6Rexpression leads to altered T cell fate and function resulting in pathogenic autoreactive T cells due to changesin the magnitude and balance of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. The following three Specific Aims willaddress this hypothesis. Aim 1 studies will determine the regulation of mbIL-6R expression in T cells from type1 diabetes (T1D), relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects at thegenetic, transcriptional, translational and post-translation level, focusing on the contribution of theIL6RAsp358Ala variant and ADAM17 mediated shedding. Aim 2 studies will determine how increased mbIL-6Ralters the magnitude and balance of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and how these changes influence theT cell response with respect to lineage commitment, homing and response to regulation. These studies willtake advantage of a cohort of healthy subjects with genetically determined mbIL-6R expression levels. Aim 3studies will determine the impact of elevated mbIL-6R expression on both total T cells and autoreactive T cellsin T1D, RRMS and RA. The primary endpoints will be T cell lineage commitment, transcriptional profile, andresponse to regulation. This aim will also determine the effect of elevated mbIL-6R expression on the isletspecific T cell response to tocilizumab in T1D.

34,No NIH Category available.,"1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (~30 lines) 2 Bronchiolitis is the #1 cause of hospitalization in US infants, with ~130,000 hospitalizations3 annually. Small cohort studies (n&lt;210) suggest that 40-50% of infants hospitalized with 4 bronchiolitis will subsequently develop asthma. The greatest challenges for developing primary5 prevention strategies for this large group of children are the very early identification of 6 modifiable risk factors and the heterogeneity of asthma. The 35th Multicenter Airway Research 7 Collaboration (MARC-35) study (U01AI-87881; Camargo, PI) is a 17-center prospective cohort 8 study that completed enrollment of 921 hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis in 2014. In this 9 diverse cohort (53% African-American or Hispanic), investigators have collected biospecimens,10 including nasal swabs at the index hospitalization (median age 3 months). Follow-up data11 include biannual parent interviews and medical records to age 5 years, with >90% follow-up to12 date. This competitive renewal would extend this largest, most comprehensive severe13 bronchiolitis cohort in the world by conducting an in-person examination at age 6 years to14 diagnose and phenotype asthma and by examining nasal airway microRNA and NF?B signaling15 mediators/outcomes, at both the index hospitalization and at age 6 years. In Aim 1, we will16 identify nasal airway microRNAs that are prospectively associated with asthma at age 6 years.17 In Aim 2, we will determine the inter-relations among airway microRNAs and inflammatory18 response (e.g., NF?B signaling) and their integrated contributions to risk of incident asthma.19 Pilot data provide compelling support for our hypotheses. Lastly, using a systems biology20 approach, Aim 3 will define asthma endotypes by integrating clinical phenotype and molecular21 data (e.g., airway microRNAs and NF?B signaling) at age 6 years. Among these infants with22 severe bronchiolitis ? a natural experiment ? we will have a unique opportunity to identify airway23 microRNAs associated with incident asthma during an important period of lung development24 that would provide a critical window for primary intervention. Furthermore, using innovative25 approaches, we will not only investigate underlying mechanisms linking bronchiolitis to incident26 asthma (e.g., enhanced NF?B signaling) but also identify phenotypes/endotypes of asthma that27 are likely to respond differently to different interventions. The study will provide a strong28 evidence base for primary prevention through the future development of targeted interventions29 (e.g., microRNA-targeting therapy). The investigators are NIH-funded researchers with30 international expertise in the field.

35,No NIH Category available.,"During late 2019 and the first weeks of 2020 the suspected etiological agent of a large cluster ofpneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan was identified as a novel coronavirua. SARS-CoV-2 causesCOVID-19, and has erupted as a pandemic in a matter of months. As of 3/30/20 WHO states that there are729,100 confirmed cases globally and 34,689 deaths with the US now having the most cases. Currently novaccines or proven effective therapies exist, leaving transmission control measures to rely on draconianinfection control procedures. Exceptionally high rates of severe infection requiring hospitalization, intensivecare and respiratory support paired with unprecedented restriction of person-to-person contact has resulted inpreviously unseen global consequences on individuals' health, mortality, travel, quality of life and theeconomy. A report of, 72,314 cases in Wuhan resulted in an enormous case-fatality rate of 14.8% in thoseaged ?80 years, 8.0% age 70-79 years, and 2.3% overall. COVID-19 has spread to 30 nursing homes (NH) in the Seattle area as of March 30th and over 150 NHnationally by March 23rd. The first 120-bed NH in Seattle had 81 COVID+ residents, resulting in 35 deaths atmortality rate of 29%. Importantly, at least 47 staff also developed symptoms or were COVID+. Thesemortality rates highlight the consequence of our current inability to detect infection and monitor transmissionin care facilities with a large number of staff that care for a high-density resident population that is the mostvulnerable to infection. There are over 15,000 NH in the US providing housing to over 1.4 million individuals.These NH residents are typically very elderly, frail, and have multimorbidities. Many millions more within theUS share a similar clinical status but live in assisted living or at home where family care for them. The need tounderstand vulnerability, transmission and develop efficacious therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 in the NHresident is absolutely critical. One of the greatest challenges in an infectious disease outbreak is in determining which patients havemild forms of illness and may be quarantined in place and which patients have or may progress to severeforms of illness and require additional care or hospitalization in another facility. Furthermore, the earlyidentification of those patients that will progress to severe forms of the disease needing further admission tothe ICU is crucial to increase their chances of survival. Here we propose to conduct a surveillance andtransmission study through which we will obtain samples that allow us to identify early biomarkers of COVID-19 disease severity or potential for disease severity, that could be used with clinical information to assistclinical decisions in a predictive fashion to stratify patients to the appropriate level of care.Aim 1. Epidemiology: Determine the incidence and prevalence of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, andsymptomatic COVID-19 in long-term care residents and the clinical course of their infection longitudinally.Aim 2. Transmission: Assess frequency and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after an incidentCOVID+ resident is identified in the long-term care setting.Aim 3. Immunobiology and Biomarkers: Use systems biology approaches to characterize and follow thevirus:host interface and longitudinal host immune responses in COVID+ long-term care residents. Our group has performed multiple NH-based studies in the last 5 years including a series of largecluster randomized studies, each over 800 NH nationally to a multisite vaccine RCT to epidemiologicscreening studies. We are perfectly positioned to obtain the samples and data we propose.

43,No NIH Category available.,"ABSTRACTThis supplement was written in response to the original NOT-AI-20-031: Notice of Special Interest (NOSI):Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),and submitted under PA-18-591]. COVID19, caused by the betacoronavirus (CoV) clade SARS-CoV-2, rangesfrom asymptomatic disease to fatal multi-organ failure. Both innate and T cell-mediated adaptive immunity areimportant for limiting viral replication. Nevertheless, hyperactivation of the immune response in patients withmore severe disease may precipitate a ?cytokine storm? that results in aggravated morbidity and high mortality.Relevant to the role of immune hyperactivation in COVID disease pathogenesis are our recent studies onasthmatic inflammation showing how allergens and air pollution particulate matter (PM) overcome immunetolerance mechanisms operating in the airway to license tissue inflammation. We identified the JAG1-NOTCH4axis as a key pathogenic mechanism activated by the allergens and PM that acts as a molecular switch to breakdown immune tolerance in the lung and consequently promote inflammation. Along this mechanism we identifiedthat NOTCH4 was selectively induced on lung Treg cells in an allergen and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependentmanner, and it directed their subversion into Th2/Th17 effector-like T cells. Importantly, our preliminary resultsreveal that NOTCH4 expression is upregulated on circulating Treg cells of COVID19 subjects as a function ofdisease severity, thus implicating this mechanism in disease pathogenesis in COVID19 subjects. Our centralhypothesis is that dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity in COVID19 involves the subversion ofTreg cells in an IL-6 and NOTCH4-dependent manner. Our study team is composed of a multidisciplinarygroup of R01-funded investigators with prior collaborative work, clinical expertise in the care of critically illCOVID19 patients, and research expertise in the role of Treg cells in immunological tolerance. We propose toprofile the innate and adaptive immune responses in subjects with mild-moderate and severe COVID19 diseaseas compared to convalescent and healthy control subjects. We will correlate these changes with NOTCH4expression on circulating Treg cells and the latter?s immune regulatory functions. We will also examine the impactof Notch4 expression on transcriptional alterations in Treg and T effector cells in patients with COVID-19.

46,No NIH Category available.,"Project SummaryExploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimicsThis supplement request explores the possibility that sialoglycans may be co-receptors for SARS and COVID-19 virus spike (S) proteins, as is the case with MERS and other Coronaviruses (CoVs). Numerous virusesrecognize host cell surface glycans that terminate in sialic acids (Sias), a family of 9-carbon-backbonemonosaccharides present at very high densities on all vertebrate cell surfaces, and on most secreted proteins??particularly mucins that line and protect mucosal surfaces like the airways. Viral recognition of host sialoglycansis affected by Sia type, linkage to, and the structure of underlying glycans. Much of this natural diversity of Siasin viral infection remains underexplored. While many respiratory disease-causing viruses target Sias, Siarecognition is not currently reported in SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic virus. This stands in contrast tothe extensive literature on Coronaviruses and Sia receptors and is likely because a definitive human proteinreceptor (ACE2) for the virus S protein has been identified. A similar situation existed for the earlier MERS-CoVwhich had a well-defined receptor (DPP4) but was later found to also bind Sias via a different binding site. Giventhe very high Sia density in vivo, and the fact that Sias are the first contact of a virus on a mucosal surface, Siadiversity is likely to play important roles during natural infections. We hypothesize that airway Sias are alsorecognized by S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. This supplement is based on strong foundationsbuilt by decades of studies of Sia diversity by the collaborating labs, including the parent project which addressesinstability of Sia O-acetyl modifications by synthesizing sialosides with corresponding N-acetyl analogs. Theurgent need for more careful exploration of Sia-binding functions of SARS and MERS will utilize a uniquesialoglycan microarray built up over years of collaboration between the labs. Additional diversity of humansialosides such as those with 9-O-lactyl Sia that have heretofore not been studied, but could be critical, will alsobe explored. We propose sialoglycan microarray studies of recombinant soluble external domains of S proteinsof MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with human CoVs causing milder diseases, todetect Sia-dependent binding that has been missed so far. We will synthesize sialosides containing naturallyoccurring 9-O-lactyl-Sia and more stable 9-N-lactyl analogs and integrate these with the microarray and bindingstudies. Computational studies, including molecular dynamics simulation of binding free energies, willcomplement the array studies by predicting Sia variants that might bind, and modelling binding seen in arraystudies. These studies will generate new knowledge that may help to better understand viral infection,pathogenesis, and transmission from animals to humans and among humans. Additional viral epitopes criticalfor binding neutralization may be identified that could suggest novel preventative and/or therapeutic approachesto COVID-19. This project is therefore well suited to the urgency of the current pandemic situation.

66,No NIH Category available.,"Summary: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) threatens the entire world?s health, economy and socialstability and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The capacity of this virus to cause proteanmanifestations and resist public health control demonstrates its profound evolutionary and adaptive capacity.We have studied the experimental evolution and determinants of fidelity and adaptation of CoVs for more than20 years. The parent grant (R01 AI108197) for this proposed supplement defines the determinants of CoVreplicase proteins in virus fidelity and pathogenesis, and is specifically directed toward understanding the role ofthe unique CoV exoribonuclease encoded in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN). Using SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and MHV, we have shown that nsp14-ExoN mediates RNA proofreading and is responsible for: i) CoV highfidelity replication; ii) resistance to nucleoside analog inhibitors; iii) virus fitness; iv) evasion of host immunity;and v) virulence in vivo. Engineered mutants of MHV and SARS-CoV lacking ExoN (ExoN(-)) are impaired in allof the above functions and thus define ExoN as an exceptionally conserved and vulnerable virus encoded targetfor inhibition and attenuation. In this administrative supplement, we propose in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN, with the long-term goal define its role in virus replication and as a target for inhibitors andattenuation. We will rescue SARS-CoV-2 mutants of nsp14-ExoN and define their impact on replication anddisease. In Aim 1, we will introduce mutations into SARS-CoV-2CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN that are known in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and/or MHV to abolish proofreading, alter nucleoside analog sensitivity, impact virusreplication and fitness, or decrease virulence. Recovered viruses will be tested for these phenotypes. In Aim 2,we will select replication-competent ExoN mutants with defined phenotypes for testing in highly relevant humanairway epithelial (HAE) cultures and in a mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 replication and disease. The long-standing and highly productive collaboration between the Denison and Baric labs has already resulted indevelopment of SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics, initial analysis SARS-CoV-2 recombination, and potential animalmodels, all of which, in combination with our established bioinformatics pipelines, will allow rapid progress onthe proposed supplement aims and will provide data for longer-term detailed studies of the role of ExoN and theviral polymerase. The significance and urgency of these studies is high, as they will rapidly result in identificationof nsp14-ExoN targets for small molecule inhibitors and multiple pathways to stable and universal attenuation ofSARS-CoV-2 and future zoonotic CoVs.",2019-nCoV;Administrative Supplement;airway epithelium;Animal Model;Antiviral Agents;Appearance;attenuation;bioinformatics pipeline;Body Weight decreased;Cell Culture Techniques;Clinical;Collaborations;Competence;Coronavirus;COVID-19;Data;Development;Disease;Engineering;Evolution;Exoribonucleases;experimental study;fitness;Frequencies;Future;Genetic Recombination;Goals;Human;Immune Evasion;Immunity;Impairment;In Vitro;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;Interferons;Lung;Mediating;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Mutation;Nonstructural Protein;novel;nucleoside analog;nucleotide analog;Outcome;pandemic disease;parent grant;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Polymerase;predictive test;Proteins;Public Health;replicase;Resistance;Respiratory physiology;reverse genetics;RNA;Role;SARS coronavirus;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;social;Testing;Tissues;Viral;Virulence;Virus;Virus Replication;World Health;Zoonoses;,Determinants of Coronavirus Fidelity in Replication and Pathogenesis,Narrative: SARS-CoV-2 is a devastating zoonotic pandemic CoV.

YCC arms these investigators with a suite of enabling cores and powerful collaborativeopportunities and resources. Through intra- and inter-programmatic collaboration, the overarching goals ofYCC are to understand and prevent cancer, detect cancer early, and manage cancer treatment moreaccurately and effectively. The seven Research Programs are the heart of YCC, and each program is led by abasic scientist in partnership with a clinical/translational scientist to foster transdisciplinary research and theadvancement of Yale science from the bench to the clinic. In addition, YCC supports and manages SharedResources that provide unique expertise and enabling technologies that enrich the scope and expediteprogress of each Research Program. YCC infrastructure further enables ground-breaking clinical trials thatcapitalize on Yale science and incorporate novel designs and biomarker assessments to optimize patientselection, define treatment resistance, and inform new therapeutic approaches. Overall cancer funding (directcosts) has increased 51% from $58.2M in 2012 to $88M in 2017, including an increase from $17.8M to $23.5Min NCI funding (direct costs). YCC holds two NCI SPORE grants, a UM1, U10, multiple P01s, numerous multi-investigator R01 grants, and leadership in two SU2C Dream Team awards. Additionally, during the currentfunding cycle, YCC leveraged $5.9M, reflecting CCSG Developmental Funds and institutional support, toadvance new research and collaborations, resulting in $55.6M in new extramural funding - a 9-fold return oninvestment. During the same period, accrual to interventional treatment trials increased 82%, from 471 to 859,and accruals to early-phase treatment trials (pilot, I, I-II) increased three-fold, now representing 44% of totaltreatment accruals. No less important, YCC has expanded and invested in initiatives and research that seeksto impact cancer inequities and the needs of our catchment area at an individual, institutional, and policy level.Over the next five years, YCC will continue to develop initiatives and resources to foster innovation,collaboration, excellence and synergy to maximize the impact of Yale?s talent and expertise on theunderstanding, prevention and treatment of cancer.!",Address;Adoptive Cell Transfers;anticancer research;Area;arm;Award;Basic Science;bench to bedside;Biological Markers;Biostatistics Shared Resource;Cancer Biology;cancer care;Cancer Center;Cancer Center Support Grant;cancer diagnosis;cancer prevention;Cancer Science;cancer therapy;Catchment Area;Charge;Clinical;clinical investigation;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Community Outreach;Comprehensive Cancer Center;cost effective;design;Development;Direct Costs;Discipline;Dreams;Early Diagnosis;Education;Evaluation;experience;Extramural Activities;Faculty;Fostering;Funding;Future;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Health;health equity;Heart;Immunooncology;improved;Incubators;Individual;Infrastructure;innovation;Institutes;Institutional Policy;interdisciplinary collaboration;Intervention;Investments;Laboratories;Leadership;Malignant Neoplasms;Medicine;member;Mission;next generation;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Patient Selection;Patient-Centered Care;Patients;Phase;Physicians;Population;Population Research;prevent;Prevention;Procedures;Process;programs;Recording of previous events;recruit;Research;research and development;Research Personnel;Resource Sharing;Resources;Science;Scientist;Strategic Planning;synergism;Talents;Teacher Professional Development;Technology;therapy resistant;Time;Training;Training and Education;Translational Research;translational scientist;Translations;treatment trial;Yale Cancer Center;,Cancer Center Support Grant,OVERALLPROJECT NARRATIVEThe overarching mission of Yale Cancer Center (YCC) is to understand and prevent cancer; detect cancerearly; and manage more accurately and effectively cancer treatment.

87,No NIH Category available.,"Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are oflimited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, wehave assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify andvalidate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinaryproposal ?FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation? is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurementsand integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1)host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect theactivation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying mainhypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate diseaseoutcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previouscollaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by threeinfluenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights ininfluenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity inhumans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis,and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identifyclinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive andcomprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood froma human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions andperturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics andmetabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generatenetwork models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeuticintervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds ofperturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managedand disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies willuncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specifictherapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlatesand associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, andlink them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies.","Animals;Antiviral Agents;base;Benchmarking;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Blood;Cells;Clinical;clinically relevant;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;cohort;Collaborations;companion diagnostics;Complementary DNA;CRISPR screen;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;data integration;data management;Data Set;Disease;Disease model;Disease Outcome;early detection biomarkers;Environmental Risk Factor;epigenome;epigenomics;Experimental Models;functional genomics;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;Human;human pathogen;Immune response;in vivo;Infection;Influenza;Influenza A virus;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype;influenza virus strain;influenzavirus;insight;Integration Host Factors;Intervention;Link;Lung;Lung diseases;machine learning algorithm;Measurement;Measures;metabolome;metabolomics;Methods;Modeling;Molecular Profiling;mouse model;multidisciplinary;multiple omics;Mus;network models;Network-based;new therapeutic target;next generation;novel;Outcome;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;personalized medicine;Post-Translational Protein Processing;predictive marker;predictive modeling;Predisposition;Process;programs;protein protein interaction;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;resilience;respiratory;response;Sampling;Severities;Severity of illness;Small Interfering RNA;Source;specific biomarkers;System;Systems Biology;targeted treatment;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;therapeutic target;Tissues;transcriptome;transcriptomics;Vaccines;Viral;Viral Pathogenesis;Virulence;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;",Fluomics: The Next Generation,We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza viruspathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome; and b) provideavenues to explore for new; host-directed; therapeutic interventions.,NIAID,10132152,30-Mar-20,RFA-AI-16-080,3U19AI135972-03S1,3,U19,AI,135972,3,S1,"SHABMAN, REED SOLOMON",30-Mar-20,31-Dec-22,Special Emphasis Panel (ZAI1-EC-M (S2)),,2104524,"GARCIA-SASTRE, ADOLFO ",Not Applicable,13.0,MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY,78861598,US,40.790525,-73.953788,3839801,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10029-6574,UNITED STATES, ,30-Mar-20,31-Dec-20,855,Research Projects,2020,NIAID,514291.0,121625.0,635916,,"['garcia-sastre, adolfo']","['garcia-sastre, adolfo']"

The pandemic has interfered with many other importantendeavors, including NIH-sponsored non-COVID HIV clinical trials. We need robust plans to implementmeasures to expand SARS CoV-2, allowing research units to resume studies being conducted on HIV, whilemaintaining the safety and well-being of participants and staff. To this end, we have developed strategies relyingon a combination of testing for active disease, evaluating seroprevalence, and conducting operations in waysthat enforce social distancing and utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE). This project is beingimplemented at the Vanderbilt Therapeutics Clinical Research Site (VT-CRS), and the Washington UniversityPrevention & Therapeutics (WPT) CRS. This strategy will comprise two aims that involve research participants,their household contacts, and staff: Aim 1) To utilize resources obtained through this administrative supplementto expand SARS-CoV-2 testing within the regions of our Clinical Research Sites; and Aim 2) To utilize resourcesobtained through this administrative supplement to more quickly and fully resume on-site research activities atour Clinical Research Sites. Among the activities to be implemented are universal testing of study participantsfor infection by CoV-2 PCR prior to study visits, either by staff during parking lot drive-through visits or self-collected remotely by study participants. At one CRS, testing will also be offered to adult household contacts ofstudy participants. There will be active screening for symptoms of COVID-19. There will be CoV-2 antibodytesting at the beginning and end of the project period, of staff and/or study participants.

108,No NIH Category available.,"A recent analysis shows that nearly 1 in 5 clinical trials either terminated for failed participant accrual, or completedwith &lt;85% of the expected enrollment. These recruitment challenges ultimately reduce the speed with whichadvances in medicine reach the general population. Recruitment strategies should at the forefront of protocoldevelopment discussions; however, clinical research teams often discuss recruitment strategies only after crudepatient estimates suggest feasibility, and after a study protocol has been written, approved by an IRB, and is readyto enroll the first patient. Not surprisingly, study coordinators then find themselves with thedifficult task of recruiting patients who meet narrow inclusion criteria, and retaining participants through numerous(sometimes onerous) study visits. The Recruitment Innovation Center program has the potential to truly transformthe research recruitment and enrollment landscape. We propose a set of innovative, integrated solutions torecruitment and enrollment challenges that accommodate real ethical, regulatory, legal, practical, and technicalconstraints faced by investigators. These will be available through the Improving Clinical Trial Education,Recruitment and Enrollment at CTSA Hubs (I-CERCH) Center. Solutions will be available to investigators for everystage of recruitment: foundational recruitment education, study cohort identification and estimation, communityengagement, pre-screening, informed consent, enrollment and retention monitoring, and returning of researchresults. Underlying our solutions will be a national, disease-neutral and informatics supported system that supportsenrollment for individual trials. We will build upon existing recruitment and data tools and resources already in useby our team and others (e.g. ResearchMatch8, RecordCounter, REDCap9,TrialFinder, and SubjectLocater) toassemble a sophisticated informatics-based recruitment infrastructure. The informatics infrastructure will be pairedwith study-specific support provided by recruitment specialists, customizable recruitment materials, andmeaningful community engagement. I-CERCH will be led by Paul Harris, PhD, who will serve as PI responsibleinformatics development, and Consuelo H. Wilkins, MD, MSCI, who will serve as PI of community and stakeholderengagement. Partnerships with 4 other CTSAs provide broad understanding of CTSA needs and key expertise.The specific aims of the program are as follows: 1) Provide a national home and collaborative `storefront' for thecreation, storing, and sharing of recruitment education, programs, and best practices; 2) Catalyze enrollment bydeveloping and disseminating novel technical and procedural approaches to support researchers in recruitingparticipants; 3) Enhance national awareness of research through patient education, and facilitate participantidentification of studies with novel online patient facing tools; and 4) Conduct rigorous studies on methods toenhance recruitment efficacy/efficiency and make modifications based on these data.",Awareness;base;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Communication;Communities;COVID-19;Data;data resource;data tools;Development;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Enrollment;Ethics;Feedback;Foundations;Funding;General Population;Home environment;improved;inclusion criteria;Individual;Informatics;informatics infrastructure;Informed Consent;Infrastructure;innovation;Institutional Review Boards;Legal;Medicine;Methods;Modification;Monitor;novel;Participant;Patient Education;Patient Recruitments;Patients;programs;protocol development;Protocols documentation;recruit;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;screening;Specialist;Speed;Support System;TimeLine;tool;Trust;Visit;,Improving Clinical trial Education; Recruitment; and Enrollment at CTSA Hubs (I-CERCH),Protecting the national trust in research infrastructure as it responds to the COVID-19 world isessential.

COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly affectinghumans around the globe. While initial epidemiological data have focused on cases thatresulted in severe respiratory disease seen predominantly in adults, little information regardingthe infection burden in children is available. This is complicated by the observation that manyvirologically-confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic. Undocumented, and likelyinfectious, cases could result in exposure to a far greater proportion of the community thanwould otherwise occur. Indeed, it has been proposed that undocumented (or silent) infectionsare the source for almost 80% of documented infections; thus, it is critical to determine the silentand symptomatic infection rate in children. To overcome challenges for clinical studyimplementation imposed by current healthcare access restrictions, a surveillance study underdesign will enroll and prospectively observe eligible children, and their family members, that arecurrent participants in our NIH-funded, ongoing, birth cohort studies. These children and theirfamilies are known to research staff and as part of their participation in HFHS studies, they havealready been exposed to the procedures involved in a surveillance study. We are requestingsupport for the pediatric studies aligned with our Microbiota and Allergic Asthma PrecisionPrevention (MAAP2) (PI: Johnson, Ownby P01AI089473) to participate in the multi-centersurvey entitled Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), Protocol #DAIT-COVID-19-001. Our primary objective is to report the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection(detection of virus in nasal secretions) over time in cohort children (index child) and householdcontacts (caregivers and siblings). A secondary objective is to compare SARS-CoV-2 infectionstatus and antibody development for index children/siblings with atopic conditions (e.g. asthma,eczema) versus children without atopic conditions. As an exploratory aim, we will investigatewhether SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by virus detected in nasal secretions) isassociated with the presence of virus in stool. Our targeted enrollment is 300 families recruitedover a 2-week period and followed for a minimum of 6 months. At predetermined intervals,biological samples (nasal swabs, peripheral blood, stool) will be collected by the caregiver athome using materials provided to the family. Symptom and exposure surveys will be completedremotely via a smart phone, on-line, or telephone at the time of biological sample collection.This timely, multi-site study can be rapidly implemented and realistically conducted withoutnecessitating any visits to a clinical research center and will provide invaluable information onthe infection burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children.",2019-nCoV;access restrictions;Adult;Affect;Antibodies;Asthma;Biological;Birth;Caregivers;Cellular Phone;Child;Childhood;Clinical Research;cohort;Cohort Studies;Communicable Diseases;Communities;COVID-19;design;Development;Eczema;Emergency Situation;Enrollment;epidemiologic data;Epidemiology;Exposure to;Extrinsic asthma;Family;Family member;Feces;Funding;health care availability;Home environment;Household;Human;Incidence;indexing;individualized prevention;Infection;infection burden;infection rate;Lung diseases;microbiota;Nose;Participant;peripheral blood;Procedures;prospective;Protocols documentation;recruit;Reporting;Research;response;sample collection;Sampling;Siblings;Site;Source;surveillance study;Surveys;Swab;Symptoms;Telephone;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;viral detection;virology;Virus;Visit;,Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS),Project NarrativeWe will conduct a study to enroll and observe eligible children and their family members that arecurrent participants in our NIH-funded studies in order to report the presence and occurrence ofinfection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) in children and household contacts.,NIAID,10144521,18-May-20,PA-18-591,3P01AI089473-06S1,3,P01,AI,89473,6,S1,"MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL",18-May-20,31-Aug-21,,,1968885,"JOHNSON, CHRISTINE C  ","OWNBY, DENNIS R",13.0,Unavailable,73134603,US,42.375209999999996,-83.077938,218602,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,DETROIT,MI,Independent Hospitals,48202-3450,UNITED STATES, ,18-May-20,31-Aug-20,855,Research Projects,2020,NIAID,89248.0,45070.0,134318,,"['johnson, christine c', 'ownby, dennis r']","['johnson, christine c', '']"
142,No NIH Category available.,"PROJECT SUMMARYThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-driven coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic has fundamentally changed our world, country, community and families. In patients whodie of COVID-19, activation of evolutionarily-conserved inflammatory cascades results in massive increases incirculating levels of inflammatory cytokines producing vascular leak, edema of multiple critical organ (lung,kidneys, heart, brain, liver, GI tract), ultimately leading to multi-organ dysfunction including acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS). There is lack of deep understanding regarding the risk factors for and biology ofCOVID-19. The pandemic has also dramatically highlighted the multiple unmet needs in the care for patientswith SARS-CoV-2 infection including the lack of validated biomarkers, and of effective FDA?approvedpharmacotherapies. Accordingly, this Administrative Supplement seeks to further our understanding throughimmunophenotyping patients who develop COVID-19. We will provide clinical data and samplecollection/processing from a cohort of SARS-CoV2 patients enrolled in Tucson, Arizona. The clinical data andsamples will be transmitted to the central cores that are assigned by the Immunophenotyping Assessment in aCOVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study with the overarching objectives to better understand the pathogenesisof COVID-19 disease and to identify immunological pathways that can be used to inform us on how tocombat this disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will recruit and provide clinical data (demographics, clinicallaboratory test results and imaging results, clinical course) longitudinally from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection to the designated IMPACC cores in order to establish correlation with immune status and diseaseprogression. In Specific Aim 2, we will provide biological specimens (serum, whole blood, PBMCs,nasopharyngeal samples, endotracheal aspirates) from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection to thedesignated cores in order to characterize the immunophenotypes and the immune status and response toinfection. This supplement supports the University of Arizona's participation in IMPACC to facilitate screeningand enrollment of inpatients with COVID-19. The proposed supplement research is within the scope of parentU19 grant entitled ?Dysfunction of Innate Immunity in Asthma? (1U19AI125357). In summary, the IMPACC studycoordinates a national, multi-institution consortium, collecting detailed clinical data and biologic samples fromhospitalized COVID-19 infected individuals, with the goal of identifying immune signatures/molecular biomarkersassociated with clinical disease course. These data will allow the prioritization of clinical interventions andtherapeutic decision making.",Administrative Supplement;Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Allergic inflammation;Applications Grants;Arizona;Aspirate substance;Asthma;asthma exacerbation;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Course of Disease;Clinical Data;cohort;Cohort Studies;combat;Communities;Coronavirus;Country;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;cytokine;Data;Data Collection;Decision Making;demographics;Disease;Disease Progression;drug development;Edema;effective therapy;endotracheal;Enrollment;Failure;Family;FDA approved;Functional disorder;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Goals;Grant;Heart;Heterogeneity;Hospitalization;Image;Immune;Immune response;Immune System Diseases;immunological status;Immunologics;Immunology;Immunophenotyping;improved;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;Inpatients;Institution;Intervention;Kidney;Knowledge;Laboratories;Liver;Lung;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome;molecular marker;Molecular Profiling;mortality;Natural Immunity;novel;novel coronavirus;Organ;pandemic disease;parent grant;Parents;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patients;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pharmacotherapy;precision medicine;recruit;Research;Resolution;Risk Factors;sample collection;Sampling;screening;Serum;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome;Specimen;System;Test Result;Therapeutic;Universities;Viral Pathogenesis;Virus;Virus Diseases;Whole Blood;,The Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC),NARRATIVEIn less than six months; the COVID-19 infection has become a word-wide pandemic and fundamentally changedour world.

In the current application, we summarize research accomplishments anddocument fulfillment of the NCI?s Six Essential Characteristics for NCI-Designated Centers. The mission ofNCCC is to accelerate trans-disciplinary research to prevent and cure cancer, enhance survivorship, andpromote health equity, evident in significant funded patient-centric population science and diversity-focusedengagement of trainees across the education continuum. Reflecting deep integration within our hostinstitutions, NCCC is comprised of four truly trans-disciplinary research programs, reflecting active NCCCPlanning & Evaluation: Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI); Translational Engineering in Cancer(TEC); Cancer Biology and Therapeutics (CBT); and Cancer Population Sciences (CPS). Included in ourresearch portfolio are groundbreaking scientific initiatives in cancer immunology, cancer engineering, biologicalmechanisms, experimental therapeutics, molecular epidemiology, health care delivery science and cancerprevention and control, with an enhanced emphasis on translating research discoveries to hard-to-reachpopulations, especially those within our rural two-state catchment area of New Hampshire and Vermont. NCCCcontinues to be defined by its high impact scientific publications and the frequency with which they are enabledby Cancer Center support of trans-disciplinary research, as evidenced by inter- (31%) and intra-(17%) co-authorships, cancer themes in IDeA-funded program projects, and access to NCCC Shared Resources thatinclude several (e.g., Pathology, Trace Elements, Genomics) relied upon widely by other NCI designatedcenters. Consistent with our commitment to both high quality science and the successful translation ofresearch discoveries to the clinic, the past five years have witnessed an 18% increase in our NIH-fundedresearch portfolio, including a >7:1 return on Developmental Funds, and a 62% increase in clinical trialsaccrual, including funding as an NCTN lead participation site. Depth of Leadership was evidenced byaccomplishments during a recent Director transition. Shortly following the September 2017 arrival of Dr. StevenLeach as Center Director, NCCC embarked upon a new 2018 Strategic Plan, which identified acceleratingtranslational and trans-disciplinary research as our single highest overarching strategic priority.

One of the main challenges to studies of the immune system has been thelimited availability of human samples reducing our ability to perform in-depth comprehensive analysis ofimmune functions in patients. The goal of this application is to develop novel immune profiling tools andfunctional assays to identify novel targets and novel biomarker of diseases and response to therapy intwo clinical areas: food allergy and IBD. The initial focus on these two disease areas reflects theextraordinary ISMMS clinical recruitment of allergic and IBD patients, yet any technological developmentobtained in this grant will be applied to other inflammatory disease such as atherosclerosis, and skininflammatory disease including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis for which ISMMS is also a referral center.Food allergy is a common disease of childhood for which there are no treatment or prevention strategies. ThePediatric Allergy and Immunology division at ISMMS has built one of the most active clinical researchprograms in food allergy in the country. Mechanistic insights have lagged behind clinical gains due to thedifficulty of profiling allergen-specific cells, particularly given the challenge of small blood volumes availablefrom pediatric patients. Thus one of the goals of this proposal is to develop novel immune and genomics toolsto identify and profile allergen-specific T cells at the single-cell level.The ISMMS Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Center is unique in its close, integrated collaborationsbetween world-leaders in clinical, genetic, microbiome and immunology-based IBD research. While efforts toexplore immune regulators causative of disease has focused on exploiting GWAS data and exploring systemicdysregulation, little effort has been devoted to comprehend the nature of the immune dysregulation that occursat the tissue site mainly due to limited availability of gastrointestinal tissue. Thus Aim 2 of this project proposesto leverage the extraordinary tissue samples obtained by the ISMMS IBD Center to develop novelimmunological assays to profile immune cell compartments that infiltrate and contribute to IBD lesions in earlydiagnosed patients and at different time after initiation of immunodulatory agents.",Allergens;Allergic;Antigens;Area;Atherosclerosis;Atopic Dermatitis;Award;base;Biological Assay;Biological Response Modifiers;biomedical referral center;Blood Volume;Cell Compartmentation;Cells;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Country;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Food;Food Hypersensitivity;Funding;gastrointestinal;genome wide association study;genomic tools;Goals;Grant;Human;Hypersensitivity;Immune;immune function;Immune system;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunology;Immunology procedure;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;insight;Intestines;Lesion;Medical Genetics;medical schools;microbiome;Nature;novel;novel marker;outcome forecast;Parents;Patients;pediatric patients;Prevention strategy;programs;Psoriasis;recruit;Research;response;Sampling;Site;Skin;T-Lymphocyte;targeted biomarker;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissues;tool;treatment strategy;,Novel tools to maximize profiling of tissue and antigen specific immune dysregulation in allergy and inflammatory bowel disesase,The goal of this application is to develop novel immune profiling tools to assess the dysregulation of allergen-specific T cells in food allergic children as well as dissect the nature and functional state of the immune cellcompartment that infiltrate and contribute to inflammatory gut tissue lesions in IBD patients.,NIAID,10157072,24-Jun-20,PA-18-591,3U24AI118644-05S1,3,U24,AI,118644,5,S1,"DAVIDSON, WENDY F",24-Jun-20,31-May-21,,,7943382,"MERAD, MIRIAM  ","BERIN, MARIA CECILIA",13.0,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,78861598,US,40.790525,-73.953788,3839801,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10029-6574,UNITED STATES, ,24-Jun-20,31-May-21,855,Other Research-Related,2020,NIAID,218200.0,151649.0,369849,,"['merad, miriam', 'berin, maria cecilia']","['', 'berin, maria cecilia']"
204,No NIH Category available.,"Project Summary/AbstractCOVID-19, the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly affecting humans around the globe.While initial epidemiological data have focused on cases that resulted in severe respiratory disease seenpredominantly in adults, little information regarding the infection burden in children is available. This iscomplicated by the observation that many virologically-confirmed cases in children are asymptomatic. Homeenvironments are established sources of exposure that exacerbate symptoms of asthma and home-basedinterventions are proven effective. Prior to the inception of the School Inner-City Asthma Study (SICAS-1), noAmerican study had comprehensively evaluated the relationship between urban exposures in school,classroom, and home environments and asthma morbidity. Nearly all elementary school children spend 7 to12 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. From SICAS-1, we learned thatstudent classroom-specific mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutant exposure is associated withworsening symptoms. We also demonstrated our ability to reduce these exposures in a busy, school setting.Our proposal builds upon our established, successful school-based infrastructure to determine whether aschool/classroom intervention will efficiently and effectively improve asthma morbidity by reducing theseexposures. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of school/classroom based environmental intervention inreducing asthma morbidity in urban schoolchildren. Our central hypothesis is that reducing classroom/schoolexposure to mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutants will decrease asthma morbidity in students withasthma. We plan to test this hypothesis in an intervention study of 250 elementary students with asthma frommultiple classrooms in 40 Boston inner-city elementary schools. Our clinical trial aims are to determine theeffectiveness of a school/classroom based environmental intervention (school integrated pest managementand classroom air purifying filter units within these schools) to reduce asthma morbidity.

210,No NIH Category available.,"Project Summary/AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide emergency causing major social and economic disruptions. As anemergent viral infection, there are major knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19. In particular, there is limitedinformation thus far on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their infants. Initial studies suggest thatclinical manifestations during pregnancy are similar to those identified in non-pregnant adults, and recent reportshave described cases of severe pneumonia and ARDS in pregnant women. Information on the impact of maternalinfection on the infant is also limited. Investigators in China documented perinatal transmission in a small numberof newborn infants. A common feature of severe COVID-19 appears to be inflammation, which is a known riskfactor for poor pregnancy outcomes and can impact the development of the infant immune system.Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the role of COVID-19 during pregnancy and its impact on the infant.Our Parent U01 is focused on high-resolution analysis of immune responses in healthy infants. The goal of thissupplement is to determine how maternal COVID-19 infection affects the infant immune system, which we willachieve by analyzing the interplay between the maternal and infant immune systems in the context of COVID-19. We hypothesize that COVID-19 during pregnancy leaves a stable imprint on the infant immune systemdefined by enhanced inflammation and dysregulated responses to vaccines.

The CUCollege of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S), Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH), College of DentalMedicine (CDM), and School of Nursing (SON) are all at CUMC together with major components of New YorkPresbyterian Hospital (NYP) and the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). The vision of the IrvingInstitute is: 1) to transform the culture of biomedical research enabling CUMC investigators to develop newtreatments faster and deliver those treatments to patients more efficiently, effectively, and safely than everbefore; 2) to utilize medical research advances to benefit patients and the community, converting knowledgeinto practice; and 3) to recruit, train, support and nurture the next generation of clinical and translationalinvestigators in multi- and interdisciplinary team science environments. Since first receiving CTSA funding in2006, we embraced a vision that would impact maximally on a) individuals, particularly junior faculty andtrainees, b) groups of faculty and trainees working in common areas of interest but often in relative isolation,and 3) the institutional culture. We believed that this bottom-up approach was necessary if we were to moveCUMC from a system that rewarded individual effort more than the achievements of groups. After nine years,we are certain that we have changed the environment significantly, and that CUMC and NYP both understandthat multidisciplinary team efforts are essential for success in this era of greater complexity both in science andin clinical care. Additionally, we all have come to understand that only by engaging our patients early in theresearch process, particularly those individuals in the communities of Northern Manhattan (NM), will we gaintheir trust and enthusiasm, two keys to their participation in the revolution generated by Precision Medicine.Our aim is to expand, enhance, and improve the Irving Institute's CTSA Hub, to ensure that we create anoutstanding environment where junior and senior faculty, trainees, clinical research coordinators, nurses,support staff, and patients, particularly members of the underserved and underrepresent communities of NMare all engaged in, and benefit from, our efforts to meet the exciting and unique opportunities afforded by theCU/NYP Precision Medicine Initiative and the extraordinary advancements in information technologies, `omics',and therapeutic possibilities.

Preventive approaches require an understanding of thevirus prevalence and herd immunity in the general population. To evaluate the sero-prevalence of immunityagainst SARS-COV-2 in the United States, this scientific partnership of academic medical centers and theNIH's intramural research program will examine the population prevalences of detectable antibodies to SARS-COV-2 from a convenience sampling of adults in the U.S. who have not been diagnosed with COVID-19 (Aim1) and will determine the immune attributes associated with health outcomes (Aim 2), including for those inunderrepresented populations and across the life course. From a cohort of >400,000 self-referred,asymptomatic adults nationwide, a near-representative subset will be selected based on demographics suchas age, race/ethnicity, and geography to provide blood samples for characterization of antibodies and otherimmunologic markers to inform the development of screening and neutralization assays. This work benefitsfrom the deep expertise in the basic and applied research of infectious diseases as well as viral vaccinedevelopment, host immune response to viruses, and viral molecular biology and genetics at the NationalInstitute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It also leverages the rigorous and efficient capacitymaintained by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Hubs to rapidly engage diverse cohorts ofparticipants nationally to accelerate translational research that is high priority scientifically and for eventualpublic health practice. From this study, the collaborative team will gain crucial insights into the magnitude of theCOVID-19 pandemic across the country and will identify potential targets for a vaccine.

240,No NIH Category available.,"AbstractThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes the highly contagious coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a global pandemic. COVID-19 cases in the New York City (NYC) tri-statearea continue to rise exponentially and the region is now the epicenter of the crisis in the United States. InNYC alone, there are over 21,000 cases (~40% ?40 years of age) as of March 26, 2020. Many symptomaticCOVID-19 patients have features of a cytokine storm and/or macrophage activation syndrome, includingelevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6. An overly robust local neutrophil influx may also contribute to the robustimmune response with associated severe cardiopulmonary complications, including acute respiratory distresssyndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Colchicine is a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby blockingconversion of pro-IL-1? to active IL-1?, which leads to secondary reductions in other cytokines including IL-6along with inhibition of macrophage activation. Colchicine also preferentially accumulates in neutrophilscompared with other inflammatory cells and inhibits chemotaxis, endothelial adhesion, and extravasation ofneutrophils at sites of endothelial or tissue inflammation. The effects of colchicine in preventing the cytokinestorm and/or macrophage activation syndrome that leads to clinical deterioration in COVID-19, however, is notknown. Colchicine is not known to inhibit acquired immunity, and is not contraindicated in patients withinfection.The COLCORONA study is a Canadian government-funded randomized trial of colchicine vs. placebo for 30days in 6,000 non-hospitalized subjects ?40 years of age with COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one high-riskcriterion. This proposal leverages the COLCORONA Trial infrastructure and pragmatic study design with virtualconsent, randomization, and follow-up to rapidly implement the COLCORONA-NYC Study and allow potentialeligible subjects in the NYC tri-state area to participate. The overall aim of the study is to determine the effectof colchicine on the composite of death or the need for hospitalization in non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The data collected through the COLCORONA-NYC study will provide novel data on treatment of COVID-19patients, and have public health implications beyond the scope of the current application, including thepotential reduction in the healthcare resources heavily used in COVID-19 (e.g., hospital beds, ventilators), andpotential future use in other infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.",2019-nCoV;acquired immunity;Acute;Acute myocardial infarction;Adhesions;Adult;Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Age-Years;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Area;Biological Markers;Biology;C-reactive protein;Canada;Cardiogenic Shock;Cardiopulmonary;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemotaxis;Clinical;Colchicine;Consent;Coronavirus;cost effective;COVID-19;Critical Illness;Cyclic AMP;cytokine;cytokine release syndrome;Data;data management;Death Rate;Deterioration;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Double-Blind Method;double-blind placebo controlled trial;efflux pump;Endothelium;Enrollment;Event;Extravasation;Failure;follow-up;Funding;Future;Gout;Government;Healthcare;high risk;hospital bed;Hospitalization;Hour;Immune response;Immunosuppression;Infection;Inflammasome;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Infrastructure;Injury;Integral Membrane Protein;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-6;Laboratories;Leukocytes;Lung;Macrophage Activation;Macrophage activation syndrome;Mechanical ventilation;Membrane Glycoproteins;Myocardial Infarction;myocardial injury;Myocarditis;neutrophil;New York City;novel;P-Glycoprotein;pandemic disease;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Placebos;Pneumonia;Population;pragmatic trial;prevent;Process;Production;prophylactic;Public Health;Randomized;randomized trial;Reaction;Research;Research Design;Resources;Risk;Secondary to;Signaling Molecule;Site;Superoxides;Telemedicine;Telephone;Testing;Tissues;United States;Ventilator;Videoconferences;virtual;Virus Diseases;web portal;,Studies on the effects of colchicine on neutrophil biology in acute myocardial infarction,NarrativeCOVID-19 is a viral infection that can cause a severe inflammation reaction associated with pneumonia; lungfailure; and death in some infected patients.

283,No NIH Category available.,"Project Summary: There is growing evidence that an overexuberant innate and adaptive immune responsemay contribute to life-threatening pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 disease. On the other hand, inadequateviral control may allow severe disease to develop. Human immune system (HIS) mouse models have enormousand unique potential to model human COVID-19. Unlike other animal models, HIS mice could be used tounderstand the role of the innate and adaptive human immune systems in both controlling and driving SARS-CoV2-mediated disease and hence be used to optimize therapeutic approaches. The goal of our proposal is tooptimize HIS mouse models for these purposes. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Optimize our HIS mousemodels for the study of COVID-19. Existing mouse models are limited by the lack of human ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 receptor, in the respiratory tract. We will implant iPS cell-derived human lung bud organoids generatedfrom cord blood HSC donor cells into HLA-A2 Tg NSG mice receiving HLA-A2+ cord blood HSCs. In a secondapproach to humanizing mice for COVID-19 mouse studies, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to replace the murineACE2 gene with hACE2, allowing physiologic expression of hACE2 in NSG mice. Human HSC recipients will betreated with mouse TSLP in an AAV vector to enhance murine thymic and lymph node structure and therebyimprove human T cell development and improve peripheral vaccination responses. An alternative approach toenhancing thymus function will involve grafting of multiple pieces of thymocyte-depleted neonatal human thymustissue in multiple sites to compensate for the lack of growth potential (compared to fetal thymus) of neonatalthymus tissue. Immune reconstitution, T cell reconstitution and lymphoid structure will be followed and humoraland cellular responses to live attenuated SARS-CoV2 virus vaccination will be measured; 2) Use optimized HISmouse models to determine the kinetics of disease pathogenesis and the role of human immunecomponents in controlling infection and mediating pathologic host responses. We will first employ HISmice constructed with human cord blood HSCs and autologous iPSC-derived lung bud implants and later utilizethe above HLA-A2 hACE2 Tg model. Baseline infection with SARS-CoV2 will be assessed in non-reconstitutedanimals and compared to HIS mice. In HIS mice, we will deplete various human immune components (T cells,B cells or macrophages) to determine their impact on the course of infection and pathology associated withSARS-CoV2. In hACE2 Tg mice we will investigate the kinetics of infection of various components of therespiratory tract in combination with analysis of the human immune cell infiltrates in each locale over time. Withthese models established, we will be positioned to test therapeutic approaches during different phasesof SARS-CoV2 infection in future studies. Collectively, our models will provide critical information on the roleof human immune components in driving and protecting from COVID-19-associated pathology, allowingaccelerated optimization of immunomodulatory therapies.",2019-nCoV;adaptive immune response;Address;adeno-associated viral vector;Allograft Tolerance;Animal Model;Animals;Anti-inflammatory;Antiviral Agents;Attenuated;Autologous;Automobile Driving;B-Lymphocytes;base;Cells;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Code;COVID-19;CRISPR/Cas technology;cytokine;cytokine release syndrome;Development;Disease;Embryo;Evaluation;experimental study;fetal;Future;gastrointestinal epithelium;Genes;Goals;Growth;HLA-A2 Antigen;Human;human model;human stem cells;Immune;immune reconstitution;Immune response;Immune system;Immunodeficient Mouse;immunomodulatory therapies;immunoregulation;Implant;improved;induced pluripotent stem cell;Infection;Inflammation;innovation;Intestines;intravenous injection;Kinetics;Laboratories;Life;Locales;Lung;lymph nodes;Lymphoid;macrophage;Measures;Mediating;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Neonatal;neonatal human;novel;novel therapeutics;Organoids;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Phase;Physiological;Positioning Attribute;Pre-Clinical Model;Pulmonary Pathology;receptor;Regulatory Element;Respiratory System;response;Role;Series;Site;Structure;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Structure of respiratory epithelium;Study models;T cell reconstitution;T-Cell Development;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic evaluation;Thymic Tissue;thymocyte;Thymus Gland;Time;Transgenic Mice;TSLP gene;Umbilical Cord Blood;Vaccination;vaccination strategy;vector;Viral;Virus;,Intestinal allograft tolerance in large animals,Project NarrativeOverexuberant immune responses contribute to severe COVID-19; the disease caused by infection with theSARS-CoV2 virus; in ways that are not well-understood.

As of April 15, 2020, coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) has been confirmed in 2,035,764 people worldwide, causing a mortality of 6.42%,exceeding far beyond a mortality rate of &lt;1% from influenza. Effective treatment is urgently needed tostop the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this devastating pandemic. While current focus is ondeveloping novel therapeutics including antivirals and vaccines, mounting evidence show that manysevere COVID-19 patients suffer from respiratory failure by acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), the leading cause of COVID-19 mortality. In this study, we aim to address this majorunmet medical need. Clinically, host cells elicit two-phased responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inan early incubation and non-severe stage, immune cells such as macrophages detect the virus andproduce cytokines to eliminate the virus. But, when a protective immune response is impaired, thevirus propagates, and the disease is transitioned to a severe stage where innate inflammation isinduced by virus-caused massive tissue damage with uncontrolled cytokine release (aka CytokineStorm) from inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes, resulting in ARDS in the lungs. Ascendedpro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IFN-?, and TNF-? arereported in severe COVID-19 patients. Lung hyper-inflammation is the main cause of life-threateningrespiratory disorders at the severe stage. Notably, our study shows that transcriptional activation ofthese inflammatory cytokines is directed by major transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3 in concertwith chromatin regulators BRD2 and BRD4, and that their activities can be effectively blocked bychemical inhibitors. Motivated by our findings, in this study, we propose to identify and repurposeFDA-approved drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm through simultaneouslyblocking NF-kB and STAT3 signaling pathways. We will achieve this goal by addressing the twospecific aims: (1) identify FDA-approved drugs to block uncontrolled cytokine release induced bySARS2-CoV-2; (2) validate chemical inhibition of hyperinflammation in human immune cell linesincluding human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients.","2019-nCoV;Acute respiratory failure;adaptive immunity;Address;Administrative Supplement;Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Antiviral Agents;Autoimmune Diseases;Award;Binding;biological systems;Biology;BRD2 gene;Bromodomain;CCL2 gene;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Chemicals;Chromatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;cohesin;Colitis;Complex;COVID-19;cytokine;cytokine release syndrome;design;Development;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;effective therapy;Enhancers;Ensure;epigenetic drug;epigenomics;FDA approved;Funding;Gene Expression Profile;gene interaction;Genes;Genetic Enhancer Element;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Grant;granulocyte;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs;Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte;Histones;Human;Immune;Immune response;Impairment;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Influenza;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;interest;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-17;Interleukin-6;Investigation;Knowledge;Life;Ligands;Lung;Lysine;macrophage;Medical;Modeling;Molecular;mortality;Mus;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;new therapeutic target;next generation;NF-kappa B;novel;novel coronavirus;novel therapeutics;pandemic disease;Parents;Patients;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phosphorylation;Play;Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B;programs;promoter;Protein Family;Proteins;recruit;Regulation;Reporting;Research Project Grants;Respiration Disorders;response;RNA;RNA Polymerase II;Role;SARS coronavirus;Site;small molecule;Speed;STAT3 gene;Stat3 Signaling Pathway;Structure;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testis;Tissues;TNF gene;Transcription Elongation;transcription factor;Transcriptional Activation;Transcriptional Regulation;U-Series Cooperative Agreements;United States National Institutes of Health;Vaccines;Virus;Work;",Mechanism of BET Proteins in Th17 Cell Differentiation,PROJECT NARRATIVEHyperactivation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been recognized as themajor contributor to acute respiratory distress syndrome; the leading cause of COVID-19 mortality.Our study has uncovered the mechanism underlying transcriptional activation of these inflammatorycytokines.
